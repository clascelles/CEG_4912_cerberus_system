Spring MVC (Model View Controller):
-The Spring framework is responsible to initialize classes before it application starts.
-It is controlled by xml files located in the webapp/WEB-INF/spring directory.
-It instantiates objects like controllers, Hibenate DAOs, quartz schedulers, services and workflows.

Spring is also responsible to map our views to the appropriate controller.
It does that by looking at the URL and the HttpRequest type to figure out which function to call.
There is 2 Type of HttpRequest:	Get - Initiale page request/Page building
								Post - Processing & decision making

Ideal workflow in controllers:
-Every page has a GET (build the page)
-Every page has a POST (process information)  
-Once the information is processed, you must do a redirect to the next GET.
When an action occurs POST --> redirect --> GET of next page  (This is known as the POST/REDIRECT/GET Pattern

How to work with a controller:
-I've put an example with a lot of comments to explain every aspect of it. Please have a look at the LoginController
-There is a "bin" Hashmap to persist some objects you want to persist in the session.
